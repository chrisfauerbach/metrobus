Proof of concept and example for smart routing on a dumb bus.

This is a small project focused on my blog posts around routing on a message bus that's dumb.  Like Kafka.

Fast Cache:    https://medium.com/capital-one-developers/blazing-fast-data-lookup-in-a-microservices-world-dd3ae548ca45

I use some of the cacheing ideas in here for a few of my data lookups.



## NOTE
This is a personal project and has nothing to do with my employer or any contracts/clients I have.     I will build this project out to be MIT licensed though, for anyone to use and abuse.
